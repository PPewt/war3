# Warcraft 3 Stuff

This repository contains various Warcraft 3 code (old and new) that I wrote in
the past, and may yet write more of. This is currently just a small selection
of some of my more recent stuff, which is mostly still quite old.

Warcraft was how I first got into programming seriously and even though
I don't revisit it very often these days it retains a special place in my
heart. It taught me a lot of lessons about how to write (and how not to write)
software, as well as how to work around various limitations in the language.
While most of the code in this repository was written after the community
developed various editor extensions to add important language features like
data structures which made our lives easier, base Warcraft 3 had pretty much
nothing other than global arrays and various primitive data types, while
the entire scripting language (and editor in general) was buggy and
undocumented. I'm surprised at how much we managed to do, and for all its flaws
Warcraft III still has by far the best difficulty to outcome ratio of any
game editor I've ever seen: most others are far too primitive (most other RTS
editors) or far too powerful and thus difficult to use for new hobbyists (the
Starcraft II editor as well as the various real game engines).
